                    <p class="card-text">
                        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Never Never Land (“NNL,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) website,
                        accounts, ticketing, and membership services (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms.
                        If you do not agree, do not use the Services.
                    </p>

                    <h4>1. Eligibility & Accounts</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        You must be at least 13 to use the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials
                        and for all activity under your account. You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2. Tickets, Passes & Redemptions</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Purchases may include dated tickets, undated tickets, and membership-style passes. A user account may hold only one active pass
                        at a time; pass types (e.g., Family, Family+, VIP) determine benefits and guest allowances. Digital passes may be delivered
                        electronically (e.g., email, PDF, barcode) and may require ID matching the account holder at redemption. Passes and tickets are
                        generally non-transferable unless explicitly stated otherwise.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Pricing, Taxes & Seasonality</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Prices may vary by date, season, promotion, or demand and may change at any time prior to purchase. Applicable taxes and fees
                        are displayed at checkout. Seasonal pricing and validity windows are defined by NNL and may be updated periodically.
                    </p>

                    <h4>4. Payments & Third-Party Processors</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Payments are processed securely by third-party providers, including <strong>Stripe</strong>. NNL does not store full payment card
                        numbers. By submitting a payment, you authorize our payment processor to charge your selected method for the total amount due.
                        Email communications (e.g., confirmations, pass delivery) may be sent via providers such as <strong>SendGrid</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5. Cancellations, Refunds & Reschedules</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Except where required by law or expressly stated by NNL, all sales are final and non-refundable. If NNL cancels or postpones an
                        event or temporarily closes, we may, at our discretion, offer rescheduling, credit, or an exchange of equal or greater value.
                        Expired tickets/passes have no cash value.
                    </p>

                    <h4>6. Conduct & Safety</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        You agree to comply with all posted and staff-directed rules. NNL may refuse entry or remove any person for unsafe, disruptive,
                        or unlawful behavior without refund. Certain attractions or areas may have additional safety requirements or age/height/health
                        advisories.
                    </p>
